Welcome to the **MCA SQL Course** repository! This project is designed to guide MCA students through the fundamentals of SQL, from the basics to more advanced topics. Each section (also referred to as a "module," which means a distinct part of a course or educational content) is structured to provide clear instructions, examples, and exercises to help you master SQL.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several sections (modules), each focusing on a specific aspect of SQL. Below is an overview of the sections currently available and those that will be added soon.
